# Selenium ChromeDriver downloader

A script to help keep the Selenium ChromeDriver up-to-date with the current Google Chrome browser installed on the system.

## Description

Google Chrome gets regular updates and updating the Selenium ChromeDriver manually each time is a pain. This script detects the currently installed Chrome version in the path and downloads the latest matching version of Selenium ChromeDriver directly from Google.

## Usage

Assumes $USER/bin is the current working directory.

Put chromedriver-dl.sh in your $USER/bin directory and run it from there with no arguments. Old chromedriver executable, if present, will be backed-up to chromedriver_Q.X.Y.Z.gz where 'Q.X.Y.Z' is the full numeric version of the backed-up driver. New driver will be downloaded as 'chromedriver'.

An info message will be shown, similar to one below:

```
>>> ./chromedriver-dl.sh
Google Chrome version 97.0.4692.71 found.
Selenium ChromeDriver 97.0.4692.71 installed.
```

A 3-line summary will be appended to a file called 'chromedriver-dl.log', similar to below:
```
>>> cat chromedriver-dl.log
